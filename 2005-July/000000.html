<PRE>Hi,

I created this mailing list so that SPE doc writers &amp; translators can 
keep each other in touch about the evolution of the documentation. The 
first step is translating the SPE manual in different languages. So this 
mail is mainly for translators. The following languages are in the game:
- chinese
- french
- german
- spanish
(- english of course)

This is already a nice collection. I guess it covers already the most of 
the globe.

Some of you started already. I thought first to start only with Spanish, 
but as it will take a while to translate the whole manual, it looks that 
its better to start straight. Some of you started anyway. So please go 
ahead and if you have any questions or doubts please post to this list.

The following does not have to be translated, as it might change soon: 
chapter 2 and section menu and toolbar in chapter 3.8 Of course if you 
feel like you might always do. I want to publish both the pdf and odt on 
the internet so please send me the two files.

Concerning openoffice, download it from this site untill 2.0 is out:  
<A HREF="http://download.openoffice.org/680/index.html">http://download.openoffice.org/680/index.html</A> If for some reason (but 
please try) you can not access open office. Than just use plain text, 
using only new lines for paragraphs.

Thanks for your coorporation. I hope I can release the new version of 
SPE in the end of this week, or beginning next week.

Also it would be nice if you can participate on the forums to answer the 
questions of which you know the answer.

Thanks a lot and good luck!

Stani
