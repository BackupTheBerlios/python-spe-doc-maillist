This means that the manual changes as fast as SPE itself. So before
you work on the manual always ask me for the latest version.
The most easy way for now to see the changes is to convert the file to
a txt file and use a diff viewer, unless somebody else has as a
smarter idea.
Feel free to add screenshots or contribute some text. After releasing
SPE 0.8.2 (this or next week) I will try to setup the documentation
todo wiki.
