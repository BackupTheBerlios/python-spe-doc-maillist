Subject: [spe-doc] Documentation TODO List
Message-ID: <43BE42F5.4010407@voidspace.org.uk>

Hello Stani (and others),

I once again tried uninstalling/installing OpenOffice 2 at home. It sill
failed to open manual.odt. Most frustrating.

OpenOffice here at work fine. I'm in tomorrow morning, and it's usually
quiet - so I may have a chance to look at it then. Does OpenOffice have
diff/merge/versioning capabilities ?

Anyway - I have another suggestion. This may already exist, if it does I
apologise - but I'm not aware of it.

How about a "documentation TODO list" ? This could be a list of features
that are undocumented or poorly documented.

As you add new features but don't have time to document them you can add
them to this list. Volunteers (like myself) can then look at the list
and pick an item to work on. This breaks the documentation task down
into smaller amounts. I quite enjoy writing documentation - so if I knew
*specifically* what features needed writing, then I would have a go.

Of course the list would need maintaining - but once it is created that
is a *relatively* trivial task.

All the best,

Fuzzyman

Windows XP SP2.

Ooo hangs when I try to open "manual.odt". I've tried the version with
Java and without, and uninstalling and re-installing.

When I try it at work it opens fine. I think this is an oddity with my
windows install, as I have a couple of other weird (minor) problems as well.

All the best,

Many, many time. :-)

Seriously, it just hangs. I've left it for over ten minutes before. On
my work computer it opens very quickly.

On a positive note, it looks like there is a good user/developer
community growing around SPE - very encouraging.

All the best,

The manual indeed contains hrefs, as that was the quickest. Maybe
that's the reason.

Ahh... I have an intranet without an internet connection. That means
it's hanging waiting for the connection. It never seems to return
though. *rats*.

I have a proxy server setup for this occasion (that returns 404 on all
connections so that stuff doesn't hang). I'll see if I can configure
Open Office to use that proxy.

Thanks

Subject: [spe-doc] Editing Manual without Internet
Message-ID: <43C77C33.8060303@voidspace.org.uk>

Hello all,

I confirmed yesterday that *it is* the internet connection (or lack of)
that causes my problem with Open Office.

Even with a  proxy server returning a 404, it took *twenty minutes* to
open. (I could see the requests going to my proxy server).

I can find no way of preventing Open Office from attempting to access
the internet.

I'll have to do edits as text diffs. I can save the manual as text from
work.

All the best,

Fuzzyman

Hi all,

As some of you might have noticed, I've started keeping the
documentation up to date with the latest developments of SPE. I'd like
to see that SPE doesn't suffer from which most open source project
suffer:

"Eric3 is documented as well as the other open-source projects we
looked at, which is to say, there are some screenshots and a mailing
list."

This quote comes from
http://spyced.blogspot.com/2005/09/review-of-6-python-ides.html The
author of this article, Jonathan Ellis, will review SPE for the first
time for PyCon I'd like to send him as quick as possible an updated
version. I'd like him to make quite a different comment about SPE.

COORDINATOR

I am pleased to announce that Kyle Odom volunteers to become the
documentation manager. He will from now on play an important role to
boost the documentation of SPE to another level. Correspondence should
be done through this mailing list.

TUTORIAL

What is now urgent is that Dimitri from serpia.com can finish the new
tuturial. I've updated him with the latest manual. Running files has
drastically changed since his previous tutorial. Dimitri has asked
someone to take screenshots. Jeff, maybe a student at your school can
do that, or Kyle could you otherwise do it? It is important that
Jonathan Ellis could have the updated manual with this. He would
review SPE mid january. I guess I can send the manual a bit later...

WIKI

The documentation could be still improved a lot and has still some
things not covered. Therefore Fuzzyman suggested to put a
documentation todo wiki. Good idea! I've put up a first version, which
can be improved and coordinated by Kyle. You can find it here:
http://pythonide.stani.be/dev/wiki/FrontPage

TRANSLATION

I would like to start with the Spanish translation. I think Mario has
already started with this. So Mario and Kyle now you can work
together. So green light for the manual! Mario could you make a
planning and update us about your progress?

REVIEW

All native english speakers are kindly asked to review the SPE manual
from time to time. Thanks!

DONATIONWARE

The pdf manual of SPE is donationware. It is available for free with
ads on the internet (this could be improved, but where is my time ;-)
and any donor or contributor can get it. Even if one would donate 1
euro, so I think it is still democratic.

EDUBUNTULAB

I'm also pleased to announce that SPE is now used as the Python IDE at
the Yorktown High School in Arlington, where Jeff Elkner is
responsable for CS and runs an edubuntulab. The high school could also
play an important role into SPE's documentation. Jeff writes:
"Documentation is something to which we can certainly contribute.  And
I would be delighted to work out with you how best we can do that."
For sure this could help SPE a lot, isn't it Kyle? With Jeff, I will
also try to improve SPE on Ubuntu and see how SPE could fit to
students.

OK, ACTION...

I am really happy with Kyle's offer. I hope that once the
documentation is on rails, I can have more time for SPE.

The first main question is: what can we do to send Jonathan Ellis an
improved documentation (screenshots, missing chapters, ...)?

Yes, I receipt from you(07-01-2006), the manual last version(?) dated on
06-01-2006, its ok or you have a new version? 

I finished read it, I take notes of structure, links, improvements,
etc. 

Idea: is possible then you send me a list of finished points or it could
be not rewrite or edited? Because I think start with them my
translation.

My plan is tranlate 2-3 pages for common days and lot more weekends.
Thats means I planed finish the translate on January 31 - 02
February/2006

Suggest: 
-Spe Manual: control version!!


Mi configuracion/My config:

Ubuntu Breezy 5.10
Linux Kernel 2.6.12-10-386
Python 2.4.2
wxPython 2.6.1.1Pre

rewriting the tutorial by giving suggestions and stuff.

Things which are unstable at the moment. The SPE serpia tutorials.
Dimitri, how are the other tutorials. Did they change (wxGlade and
XRCed)?

It is there already ;-) On http://pythonide.stani.be/blog I mention
changes in the manual.

They look good.

I gave my comments to Dimitri about the new tutorial already. In case
you haven't please visit the website http://www.serpia.org/spenew and
give Dimitri your feedback. Please also some native English
speakers...

Well, the wxGlade still needs a serious update because it is out of date
with the latest version of wxGlade. The current version of wxGlade is 0.4:
it adds wxWidgets 2.6 suppport and code generation of event handler stubs
for Python and C++ output. Volunteers to fix this? ;-)
The XRCed has a dead link to the source code (easy to fix)

Dear Mario,
does your translation work also include my tutorials? In that case, will you
allow me to put those translations on my website (www.serpia.org) on a
separate page?. I will give you full credit of course ;-)

Dimitri

Nice!
I will update the tutorials asap and send you the source files. The source
files are plain text except for some tags that refer to the stylesheet that
I use. As an example I will include the new spe tutorial. Beware, it is not
finished! It only serves as an example! Is this format usable for you? That
is the thing I would like to hear from you. You can easily paste the
translated text in between the stylesheet tags.
Thanks,
Dimitri

I noticed the announcement of asciidoc. Maybe this would be a better
approach then openoffice: http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc? As it

I'd like to put in about twenty votes fo ReStructured Text.

It's simple and flexible and you can generate both HTML & PDF (from LayTex).

I do screenshots using irfanview (paste into it and then ctrl-R to resize), and use the image directive.

The HTML output will be much nicer.

You could even use rest2web to autobuild contents pages and *optionally* a sidebar - and put the adsense stuff into the template for an automated build. HTML is not my strong point though.

I *really* like rest and it's kind of a standard as Python text markups go. What advantage would Asciidoc have over it ?

You would lose your nice index though (until I add indexing to rest2web) - a google search box would sort that (and you get adsense income from search pages too).

If you move to rest then you've got a volunteer to help migrate content. :-)

Having version control on the docs is *good*.

All the best,

Fuzzyman

Dear all,
I have updated the SPE, XRCed and the wxPython/wxGlade tutorials. I have to
redo the screenshots for the SPE tutorial and will do so this weekend, but
the content is as good as finished.
Mario, I will send you the content*.html files for translation asap.
Now, let's just hope that the PyCon reviewer likes SPE as much as we do!
Thanks,
Dimitri

Hello there,
the new SPE is done: http://www.serpia.org/spe
comments are VERY welcome and please be honest about it. Good content is
what counts ;-)
What do you think about the size of the screenshots for example? Rescaling
the images to a lower resolution results in a lesser quality. I have
rescaled SPE first before taking the screenshots, but too much rescaling
prior to making the screenshots made SPE look strange.

Thanks,
Dimitri

They look good Dmitri. It covers features of SPE that I would like to
use more, so I will efinitely read these. I will try and helpful
comments if any spring to mind.

My approach on screen shots is to use small ones (resized) inline with
the text. I then make the images links to the fullsize image.

All the best,

I like the actual size of the screenshots.
Clicking on a thumbnail to see the whole picture and then back to  
read the description is too much of a distraction.

I also voted before for the fullsize image. I think they immediately
look crippled smaller. Dimitri, I would try to align the total width
of the text with the images. It is more readable, when now I a have a
huge resolution, the text stretches too far horizontally.

Thanks for the great work!

Hi,
I will tweak the pages soon, but for now I will keep the images as they are
now. I will consider Fuzzyman's idea to use small imgs inline with the text
as a link to the big ones, but I am not sure about the usability aspect
about this. I could try to do something like this:
http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/ . Which is nice, but may
confuse users. What do you think?

Greetz,
Dimitri

I did the javascript lightbox thing on the www.serpia.org/spe page
Looks nice doesn't it, do you think it is usable? I only tested it in FF and
Safari.
thanks,

Hi Dimitri,
I can't see a lightbox effect, both on Ubuntu or Windows XP. Are you sure
you uploaded it? Now it just shows a bigger image.
