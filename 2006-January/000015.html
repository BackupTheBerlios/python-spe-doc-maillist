<PRE>Hi all,

As some of you might have noticed, I've started keeping the
documentation up to date with the latest developments of SPE. I'd like
to see that SPE doesn't suffer from which most open source project
suffer:

&quot;Eric3 is documented as well as the other open-source projects we
looked at, which is to say, there are some screenshots and a mailing
list.&quot;

This quote comes from
<A HREF="http://spyced.blogspot.com/2005/09/review-of-6-python-ides.html">http://spyced.blogspot.com/2005/09/review-of-6-python-ides.html</A> The
author of this article, Jonathan Ellis, will review SPE for the first
time for PyCon I'd like to send him as quick as possible an updated
version. I'd like him to make quite a different comment about SPE.

COORDINATOR

I am pleased to announce that Kyle Odom volunteers to become the
documentation manager. He will from now on play an important role to
boost the documentation of SPE to another level. Correspondence should
be done through this mailing list.

TUTORIAL

What is now urgent is that Dimitri from serpia.com can finish the new
tuturial. I've updated him with the latest manual. Running files has
drastically changed since his previous tutorial. Dimitri has asked
someone to take screenshots. Jeff, maybe a student at your school can
do that, or Kyle could you otherwise do it? It is important that
Jonathan Ellis could have the updated manual with this. He would
review SPE mid january. I guess I can send the manual a bit later...

WIKI

The documentation could be still improved a lot and has still some
things not covered. Therefore Fuzzyman suggested to put a
documentation todo wiki. Good idea! I've put up a first version, which
can be improved and coordinated by Kyle. You can find it here:
<A HREF="http://pythonide.stani.be/dev/wiki/FrontPage">http://pythonide.stani.be/dev/wiki/FrontPage</A>

TRANSLATION

I would like to start with the Spanish translation. I think Mario has
already started with this. So Mario and Kyle now you can work
together. So green light for the manual! Mario could you make a
planning and update us about your progress?

REVIEW

All native english speakers are kindly asked to review the SPE manual
from time to time. Thanks!

DONATIONWARE

The pdf manual of SPE is donationware. It is available for free with
ads on the internet (this could be improved, but where is my time ;-)
and any donor or contributor can get it. Even if one would donate 1
euro, so I think it is still democratic.

EDUBUNTULAB

I'm also pleased to announce that SPE is now used as the Python IDE at
the Yorktown High School in Arlington, where Jeff Elkner is
responsable for CS and runs an edubuntulab. The high school could also
play an important role into SPE's documentation. Jeff writes:
&quot;Documentation is something to which we can certainly contribute.  And
I would be delighted to work out with you how best we can do that.&quot;
For sure this could help SPE a lot, isn't it Kyle? With Jeff, I will
also try to improve SPE on Ubuntu and see how SPE could fit to
students.

OK, ACTION...

I am really happy with Kyle's offer. I hope that once the
documentation is on rails, I can have more time for SPE.

The first main question is: what can we do to send Jonathan Ellis an
improved documentation (screenshots, missing chapters, ...)?
